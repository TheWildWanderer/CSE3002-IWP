  <h1>Welcome to the Computer Science Department!</h1>
  <p style="font-family:courier;"><i>“In our digital age you can either program or be programmed.”</i> – Rushkoff, 2010</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Computer science is the study of computation and information . Computer science deals with theory of computation, algorithms, computational problems and the design of computer systems hardware, software and applications . Computer science
    addresses both human-made and natural information processes, such as communication, control, perception, learning and intelligence especially in human-made computing systems and machines.</p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Computer Science students do well in terms of getting <font color='red'>full-time employment</font> after graduation.</li>
          <li> According to code.org, there were nearly 500,000 computing job openings nationwide last year, and fewer than 64,000 Computer Science students graduated into the workforce. They also had the second-highest projected starting salaries of
            all majors (next to Engineering) with an average of $67,539 in 2019, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers.</li>

      <font face='Comic Sans MS'>Opportunities for true creativity and innovation</font>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>This field is about much more than programming; it’s about inventing and building solutions.</li>
          <li>A Computer Science major is an artist whose canvas may be a smartphone or PC display and whose paints and brushes are programming languages and development environments.</li>
          <li>The internet has been in existence for decades now. What was once mainly used by university and military researchers has become the most disruptive technological innovations of our time: the protocols and software of the World Wide Web.
            And it was all largely due to one person with a <font color='red'>revolutionary vision</font>. With a major in Computer Science, you’re limited only by your imagination.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <font face='Comic Sans MS'>An essential part of a well-rounded academic education</font>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Having a computing background will provide you with a foundation of knowledge, problem-solving skills, and logical thinking that will serve as an <font color='red'>advantage to you in your career in whatever field you <b>choose</b>
            </font>. Beyond the vast applicability of a Computer Science degree.</li>
          <li>It’s also seen by an increasing number of universities and employers as a sign of academic well roundedness.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <font face='Comic Sans MS'>Making a positive difference in the world</font>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Computing <font color='red'>drives innovation</font> in the sciences, such as major advances in the study of the human genome, tracking important AIDS vaccine research, and monitoring and protecting the environment—just to name a few.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <li>
      <font face='Comic Sans MS'>Be the <font color='green'><b>Cyber warriors </b></font>of today</font>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encryption algorithms—aka the mathematical rules by which secret codes are made and broken—have been at the center of a simmering spy vs. nerd war since the early 1990s.</li>
          <li>Cybercrime is a big business, as conspiratorial smugglers and hackers infuse our computers with virus attacks to steal our identities and financial data. Majoring in Computer Science will give you a leg up in making the world as well as
            your neighborhood a safer place to live, work, and play.</li>
